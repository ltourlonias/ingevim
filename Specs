# Purpose
This vim plugin is designed to automatically choose between the gnuarm-C compiler and the Ingedev compiler based on the location of the source code

# Task on opening buffer
1. Detect the compiler by looking for the path
2. Create environment variable in the buffer scope (root path, compiler command line, quickfix errorformat, ...)
3. Create mapping key to build the project

# Enhancement idea
* Break makefile to compile a simple C project without compiling the whole system
* Verify that the SDK is build before building an IngeDev project
* Automatically add the current SDK version to the IngeDev project
